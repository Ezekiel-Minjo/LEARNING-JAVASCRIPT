/**
 * The course covered 30 JavaScript array methods and other array techniques.  
Arrays are widely used for data handling, requiring many operations.  
Key considerations for choosing methods:  
- Mutate original array (push, unshift, pop, shift, splice, reverse, sort, fill) vs. create a new one (map, filter, slice, with, flat, flatMap, toReversed, toSorted, toSpliced, concat).  
- Get indexes (indexOf, findIndex, findLastIndex) vs. get elements (find, findLast, at).  
- Check values (includes, some, every).  
- Transform data (join, reduce).  
- Iterate without return (forEach).  

Additional tools:  
- Object.groupBy for grouping.  
- Array.from or new Array for new arrays.  
- Spread operator and Set for merging or unique values.  
- Set intersection for common elements.  

The takeaway: pick methods based on desired output (mutate, new array, index, element, boolean, or string) and keep a quick reference for easier selection.
